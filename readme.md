Installation
------------

This is a bootsplash for Plymouth, Windows and Mac don't use plymouth so
the theme as-is won't work. Feel free to adapt the animation frames to
other bootloaders and submit pull requests back.

```
sudo cp -rv owo.pony-directory /lib/plymouth/themes/
sudo update-alternatives --install /lib/plymouth/themes/default.plymouth default.plymouth /lib/plymouth/themes/owo.pony-directory/owo.pony-directory.plymouth 100
sudo update-alternatives --config default.plymouth # Select owo.pony-directory from your list
sudo update-initramfs -u
```
